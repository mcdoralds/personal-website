                <P>OMEN's Reward program is built on Versus System’s proprietary prizing platform SDK. It is an engagement and prizing program that allows any PC player to play and win challenges based on a variety of in-game activities. 
                    Video game publishers and development studios are able to offer real-money and prize based challenges featuring their games and products, 
                    and brands are provided a unique opportunity to connect with a growing market in a more direct way. </P>

                    The launch of OMEN Rewards allowed users of non-HP computers to engage with the OMEN brand and win prizes </p> -->
                <p> At Versus Systems, we collaborated with HP’s cross-functional teams, brand partners, game studios, agencies, partners, influencers, and the PC gaming community

                <p>Every user action through the user flow is recorded and stored across four major tables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accounts</li>
                    <li>Prizes</li>
                    <li>Campaigns</li>
                    <li>Challenges</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The dataset of user action events goes through the following pipeline:</p>

                <center><p>[screenshot of workflow (MongoDB -> PostgreSQL -> Big Query -> Data Studio or Google Sheets)]</p></center>

                <p>Prior to my onbooarding... there was like a dashboard in data studio to set a timeframe, exported to google sheets,
                    within sheets someone would use the Google Visualization API Query Language to summarize the week's data.
